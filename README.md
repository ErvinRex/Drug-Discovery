# Drug-Discovery

A collection of notebooks that provide a step-by-step guide to building a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioacitivty data given a specific disease. In this instance Monkeypox was used to produce ML classifiers that could be deployed and applied to determine the bioacitity of a drug towards the inhibition of Monkeypox proteins.
